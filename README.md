bits
====

**bits** is a C++ bitstring library. It allows reading and writing numerical values of defined bit size, at a defined 
bit offset in a memory buffer. There are no restrictions imposed on the bit size or the bit offset, making it possible 
to write values without paying attention to byte boundaries.
